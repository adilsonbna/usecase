## Overview
This project we have establish a structured approach for managing infrastructure by creating dedicated Git repositories to store configurations and deployment templates. 

To streamline the deployment of POS software updates, set up CI/CD pipelines using modern GitOps tools like ArgoCD. 

These pipelines are automated deployments across distinct environments—Development, Testing, and Production—enabling efficient testing, validation, and rollouts while reducing manual intervention.
