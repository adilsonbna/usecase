## Overview use-case
This project we have establish a structured approach for managing infrastructure by creating dedicated Git repositories to store configurations and deployment templates. 




Utilize Helm or Kustomize as tools for templating deployments in retail store environments, ensuring consistency and scalability. To streamline the deployment of POS software updates, set up CI/CD pipelines using modern GitOps tools like ArgoCD or FluxCD. These pipelines should support automated deployments across distinct environments—Development, Testing, and Production—enabling efficient testing, validation, and rollouts while reducing manual intervention.
